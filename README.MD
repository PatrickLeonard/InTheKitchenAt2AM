## Synopsis

A choose your own adventure story app of fantastical proportions. An app with a whimsical tale that allows you to control the direction of the narrative. With multiple endings, many joyful minutes can be spent exploring the varied plot lines.

This app is based on "The Interactive Story" app from Team Treehouse (https://teamtreehouse.com/) via CodeOregon. This was a lot of fun to make and a good learning app for getting user input and moving through different Android activities. It's a simple app, but a lot of fun.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.
